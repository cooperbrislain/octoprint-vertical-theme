# Vertical Theme for OctoPrint

This is a style sheet I created to rearrange and simplify
the OctoPrint interface to fit on vertical screen. The focus
is on making all the most common controls, the terminal,
as well as all the relevant status indicators available on
one screen without having to scroll or navigate tabs.

Using this style sheet does not affect the layout of OctoPrint on
typical viewport dimensions, so you should only see it if you
make the window full-screen on a vertically-oriented monitor.

To use this theme, install the Custom CSS plugin, and
paste the contents of theme.css into the text area.
